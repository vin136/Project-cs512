## Objective

Understand and model graph data to enable high-level applications like recommender systems, predict properties of novel drugs etc. This certainly involves learning. Explore the area of `Geometric Deep Learning` and produce a practical application.

## Abstract

Matrix Factorization based techniques are commonly used for recommender systems. As a concrete example consider the dataset of `user-item` ratings. Here user corresponsds to the users of the platform say `NetFlix` and the `items` corresponds to the movies on their platform. Here, we aim to formulate this as a Graph structure learning problem, where the `bipartite graph` connecting the users to the corresponding items. To enable learning - `predict the rating from the users for the unseen items`, We will want to use `Graph Neural Networks`. We will take popular datasets for recommender systems  and benchmark against conventional techniques.
